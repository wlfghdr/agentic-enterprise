# locks.yaml — Protected paths requiring a lock before modification
# See docs/LOCK-ENFORCEMENT.md for details.
#
# Each entry defines a glob pattern. Any PR that modifies files matching
# a protected pattern must have a corresponding lock file in work/locks/
# OR an inline exception (ci:lock-exempt in the commit message).

protected_paths:
  # Core operating model & identity
  - "COMPANY.md"
  - "OPERATING-MODEL.md"
  - "AGENTS.md"
  - "CONFIG.yaml"

  # Quality policies
  - "org/4-quality/policies/*.md"

  # Global templates (cross-cutting changes)
  - "**/[_]TEMPLATE-*.md"

  # Lock convention itself (meta-protection)
  - "locks.yaml"
