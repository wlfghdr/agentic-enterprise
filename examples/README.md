# Examples

This folder contains walkthrough examples showing how the agentic enterprise operating model works end-to-end. Each example follows a different path through the 5 layers and 4 loops, exercising different mechanisms of the operating model.

## Available Examples

| Example | Angle | Key Layers Exercised |
|---------|-------|---------------------|
| [Generic Feature Lifecycle](generic-feature-lifecycle.md) | External demand → product delivery | All 5 layers, all 4 loops. Complete artifact chain from signal through production operation. |
| [Company Optimization](company-optimization-lifecycle.md) | Internal signals → operating model improvement | Steering-driven. Evolution proposals, policy-as-code, meta-quality evaluation. |
| [Agent Fleet Change](agent-fleet-change-lifecycle.md) | Capability gap → agent lifecycle governance | Agent Type Registry, parallel operation, graceful deprecation, fleet composition. |

## Coverage Matrix

| Mechanism | Feature | Optimization | Fleet Change |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Signal detection | ✅ Customer signal | ✅ Internal metrics | ✅ Quality patterns |
| Signal digest & pattern alert | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Mission brief + outcome contract | ✅ Full detail | ✅ Abbreviated | ✅ Abbreviated |
| Evolution proposal | — | ✅ Full detail | ✅ Agent-specific |
| Fleet configuration | ✅ Full detail | ✅ Process streams | ✅ Agent build streams |
| Quality evaluation | ✅ Standard | ✅ Meta-quality | ✅ Agent type checks |
| Progressive rollout | ✅ Percentage-based | ✅ Division-based | ✅ Parallel operation |
| Outcome measurement | ✅ Customer metrics | ✅ Operational metrics | ✅ Agent performance |
| Operate loop | ✅ Monitoring + incidents | ✅ Policy monitoring | ✅ Fleet comparison |
| Improvement signals | ✅ 8 signals filed | ✅ 5 signals filed | ✅ 5 signals filed |
| Human checkpoints | ✅ VP Product, Eng Mgr | ✅ COO + CTO | ✅ CTO |

## How to Use Examples

These examples serve as:
1. **Onboarding material** — New team members can trace work through the full lifecycle
2. **Reference implementation** — See how signals, missions, templates, and loops connect
3. **Customization guide** — Understand what needs to change for your organization
4. **Completeness check** — Verify your implementation covers all layers, loops, and handovers

**Recommended reading order:**
1. Start with the [Feature Lifecycle](generic-feature-lifecycle.md) — it's the most common path and covers all artifacts
2. Then read [Company Optimization](company-optimization-lifecycle.md) — it shows how the operating model improves itself
3. Finally, read [Agent Fleet Change](agent-fleet-change-lifecycle.md) — it shows how the workforce itself evolves

When customizing the framework, create your own examples in this folder that reflect your company's specific ventures, divisions, and workflows.
