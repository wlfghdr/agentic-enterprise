| **Mission brief** | [BRIEF.md](./BRIEF.md) |

## Outcomes

### Outcome 1: Cost Attribution Coverage

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | All agent runs are attributed to their originating mission and division |
| **Metric** | Percentage of agent runs with cost attribution |
| **Baseline** | 0% (no cost attribution in place) |
| **Target** | 100% |
| **Measurement method** | Ratio of attributed vs. unattributed agent runs |
| **Measurement source** | Agent fleet telemetry |
| **Deadline** | <!-- set deadline --> |
| **Status** | not-started |

### Outcome 2: Work Deduplication

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Redundant agent work is detected and eliminated |
| **Metric** | Reduction in redundant agent task execution |
| **Baseline** | Current overlap rate (to be measured) |
| **Target** | ≥ 15% reduction in redundant work |
| **Measurement method** | Before/after comparison of duplicate task detection |
| **Measurement source** | Agent orchestration logs |
| **Deadline** | <!-- set deadline --> |
| **Status** | not-started |

### Outcome 3: Budget Forecast Accuracy

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Monthly fleet cost forecasts are accurate within tolerance |
| **Metric** | Forecast variance percentage |
| **Baseline** | No forecasting in place |
| **Target** | ≤ 10% variance from monthly forecast |
| **Measurement method** | Monthly forecast vs. actual spend comparison |
| **Measurement source** | Financial reporting |
| **Deadline** | <!-- set deadline --> |
| **Status** | not-started |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Cost attribution dashboard operational and covering 100% of agent runs
- [ ] Deduplication detection active and reporting reduction metrics
- [ ] Monthly budget forecast process established with ≤ 10% variance
- [ ] Cost-per-outcome metrics available per mission

## Measurement Schedule

| Checkpoint | Timing |
|------------|--------|
| **Initial check** | 2 weeks after cost attribution deployment |
| **Follow-up** | 4 weeks — first deduplication metrics |
| **Final evaluation** | 8 weeks — full cycle with forecast validation |
