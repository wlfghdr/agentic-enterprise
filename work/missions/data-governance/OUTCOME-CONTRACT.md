## Outcomes

### Outcome 1: Data Classification Coverage

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | All regulated and sensitive data assets discovered and classified |
| **Metric** | Classified data assets / total data assets |
| **Baseline** | <!-- measure current classification coverage --> |
| **Target** | 100% of regulated data |
| **Measurement method** | Data catalog completeness audit |
| **Measurement source** | Data governance platform |
| **Deadline** | <!-- set deadline --> |
| **Status** | not-started |

### Outcome 2: Policy Compliance Rate

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Rate of data access and handling operations that comply with governance policies |
| **Metric** | Compliant operations / total operations |
| **Baseline** | <!-- measure current compliance rate --> |
| **Target** | ≥ 98% |
| **Measurement method** | Continuous policy enforcement monitoring |
| **Measurement source** | Access control and audit logs |
| **Deadline** | <!-- set deadline --> |
| **Status** | not-started |

### Outcome 3: Data Quality Score

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Aggregate data quality across governed datasets (completeness, accuracy, timeliness, consistency) |
| **Metric** | Composite quality score (0–100%) |
| **Baseline** | <!-- measure current data quality --> |
| **Target** | ≥ 95% |
| **Measurement method** | Automated quality checks on governed datasets |
| **Measurement source** | Data quality monitoring platform |
| **Deadline** | <!-- set deadline --> |
| **Status** | not-started |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] 100% of regulated data classified with appropriate sensitivity labels
- [ ] Data lineage mapped for all critical pipelines
- [ ] Access policies enforced automatically with ≥ 98% compliance
- [ ] Data quality score ≥ 95% across governed datasets
- [ ] Regulatory compliance reports generated automatically
- [ ] Enterprise data catalog operational and maintained

## Measurement Schedule

| Checkpoint | Timing |
|------------|--------|
| **Initial check** | 3 weeks — classification coverage |
| **Follow-up** | 6 weeks — policy enforcement and quality scores |
| **Final evaluation** | 12 weeks — sustained governance across all metrics |
