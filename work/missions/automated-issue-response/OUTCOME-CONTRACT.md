| **Mission ID** | MISSION-2026-005 |
| **Mission brief** | [BRIEF.md](./BRIEF.md) |

## Outcomes

### Outcome 1: Resolution Time Reduction

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Reduction in mean time to resolve for L1/L2 incidents |
| **Metric** | MTTR percentage reduction vs. manual baseline |
| **Baseline** | <!-- measure current MTTR --> |
| **Target** | ≥ 70% reduction |
| **Measurement method** | Compare MTTR before/after automation |
| **Measurement source** | Incident management platform |
| **Deadline** | <!-- set deadline --> |
| **Status** | not-started |

### Outcome 2: L1 Automation Rate

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Percentage of L1 incidents resolved without human intervention |
| **Metric** | Automated L1 resolutions / total L1 incidents |
| **Baseline** | 0% (fully manual) |
| **Target** | ≥ 85% |
| **Measurement method** | Incident classification and resolution tracking |
| **Measurement source** | Incident management platform |
| **Deadline** | <!-- set deadline --> |
| **Status** | not-started |

### Outcome 3: False Positive Rate

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Rate of unnecessary automated actions triggered by misclassified alerts |
| **Metric** | False positive automated actions / total automated actions |
| **Baseline** | N/A (new capability) |
| **Target** | ≤ 5% |
| **Measurement method** | Post-action validation and human review sampling |
| **Measurement source** | Incident review process |
| **Deadline** | <!-- set deadline --> |
| **Status** | not-started |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Alert classification model operational with ≥ 95% accuracy
- [ ] L1 automation rate ≥ 85%
- [ ] MTTR reduction ≥ 70%
- [ ] False positive rate ≤ 5%
- [ ] Escalation routing validated by human review
- [ ] Post-incident reports generated automatically for all incidents

## Measurement Schedule

| Checkpoint | Timing |
|------------|--------|
| **Initial check** | 2 weeks — alert classification accuracy |
| **Follow-up** | 6 weeks — L1 automation rate |
| **Final evaluation** | 12 weeks — sustained metrics across all outcomes |
