# Signal Digests

Weekly summaries of incoming signals, grouped by theme — produced by Steering Layer agents as part of the Continuous Sensing loop (Evolution Loop 1).

## How to Create a Signal Digest

1. Use the template: `work/signals/digests/_TEMPLATE-signal-digest.md`
2. Name the file: `YYYY-WXX-digest.md` (ISO week number)
3. Submit as a Pull Request

## Naming Convention

- `YYYY-WXX-digest.md` (e.g., `2026-W07-digest.md`)

## Cadence

- **Weekly** — produced every Monday covering the previous week's signals
- **Ad-hoc** — when a pattern alert triggers (3+ related signals on the same theme)

## Who Creates

- Steering Layer aggregation agents

## Who Consumes

- Strategy Layer (prioritized signal triage — replaces raw scanning of `work/signals/`)
- Steering Layer (pattern analysis for evolution proposals)
- C-Suite executives (company health overview)
