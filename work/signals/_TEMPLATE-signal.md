## Supersession

> **When to supersede vs. file new:** Use `supersedes` when new information **invalidates or replaces** a previous signal's core observation (e.g., updated data shows the original signal was based on incomplete information). File a **new, separate signal** when the new information is **additive** — it extends, corroborates, or provides a different angle on the original signal. Superseded signals remain in the repository for audit trail purposes but are excluded from active triage.

- **Reason for supersession:** [why this signal replaces the previous one]

## Recommended Disposition

- [ ] Proceed to opportunity validation
- [ ] Defer to next planning cycle
- [ ] Monitor (set follow-up date: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Archive (not actionable)
